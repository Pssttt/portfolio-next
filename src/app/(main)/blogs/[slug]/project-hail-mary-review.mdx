> **Note**: This isn't my usual technical deep-dive. I just finished this book and loved it so much that I had to write about it. If you're looking for code, check out my other posts!

I just put this book down, and honestly, I’m just staring at the wall. You know that feeling when you finish a story so good that reality feels a bit boring? That’s where I am right now.

I went into *Project Hail Mary* expecting "The Martian 2.0"—lots of math, duct tape, and sarcasm. And sure, I got that. But I didn’t expect to find the most wholesome, genuine friendship I’ve ever read in science fiction.

## Grace and Rocky

Can we talk about Rocky? Because **wow**.

Usually, aliens in sci-fi are terrifying monsters or wise, ancient beings. Rocky is… a nerdy engineer spider made of stone who just wants to save his mate. The way Weir built their relationship was masterful.

The moment they start understanding each other, it stops being a survival story and starts being a buddy-cop movie in deep space. The "fist my bumps," the "Amaze Amaze Amaze!," the way they sass each other despite being from completely different evolutionary trees—it’s just pure joy. 

I think what hit me hardest was how lonely Grace was before this. He was just a high school science teacher who felt left behind by the academic world. Then he meets a five-legged rock spider in the Tau Ceti system, and suddenly, he’s not alone anymore. He found his equal.

## That Ending...

Okay, **massive massive spoilers** ahead, but I have to talk about the end.

The twist regarding Grace’s amnesia—that he was a coward who had to be drugged and dragged onto the ship—was a gut punch. It made him such a flawed, human character. He wasn't a hero; he was a terrified man who wanted to stay home.

But then comes the choice.

He solves the problem. He saves Earth. The beetles are sent. He has enough fuel to go home. He can go back to being a hero, eat a burger, and live out his days as the savior of humanity.

And then he realizes the Taumoeba escaped on Rocky’s ship. Rocky is going to die. Erid is going to die.

The way Grace didn't even hesitate for long. The way he turned that ship around, knowing it was a one-way trip, knowing he would never see Earth, never eat real food, never breathe our air again... just to save his friend.

> "I'm coming, Rocky."

That line? Chills. Literal chills. 

That redemption arc from "coward who was forced to go" to "man who voluntarily exiles himself to save an alien friend" is what makes this one of the best sci-fi books I have ever read. It wasn't about the science in the end; it was about loyalty.

## March 2026 Can't Come Soon Enough

I am terrifyingly excited for the movie this March. Ryan Gosling has the range to pull off Grace’s sarcasm and his vulnerability, but the real test is going to be Rocky. 

If they get Rocky’s voice right—that musical, synthesized hum—and nail the "Amaze!" moments, "You sleep, I watch!", I’m going to be a mess in the theater.

If you haven't read it yet, please do. If you have, you know exactly why I’m obsessing over a fictional space spider right now.

*Amaze.*
